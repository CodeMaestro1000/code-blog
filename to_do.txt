Use 'collectstatic' command to compile all static files throughout the project so that Django can serve them in production.
STEPS:
- Set the STATIC_ROOT configuration, which is the absolute location of these collected files, to a folder called staticfiles.
- Set STATICFILES_STORAGE, which is the file storage engine used by collectstatic.
- Use the 'WhiteNoise' package to serve the static files in production.
  STEPS:
  - add whitenoise to the INSTALLED_APPS above the built-in staticfiles app
  - under MIDDLEWARE add a new line for WhiteNoiseMiddleware
  - change STATICFILES_STORAGE to use WhiteNoise
